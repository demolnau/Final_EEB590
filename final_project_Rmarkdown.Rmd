## Homework 3
This assignment is due prior to the last day class. You are to self-select and work in groups: 2-3 in a group. For the assignment below submit one R-script. Annotations via comments are highly encouraged. The script should run!

### Assignment:

1: Obtain a dataset. This may be one of your own, a dataset from DRYAD, or some other source. Identify hypotheses for this dataset and analyze patterns in the data. You may use any methods learned during the semester, but at least one analysis must come from material learned in weeks 11-13.

USE COMMENTS IN THE R CODE to describe what the patterns you find represent.
